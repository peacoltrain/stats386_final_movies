    "text": "The film industry has undergone dramatic changes over the past two decades. From the rise of streaming platforms to shifts in genre popularity and production trends, understanding what drives profitability in cinema is crucial for directors, actors, producers, etc. This project explores a large dataset of theatrical movie releases from 2005 to 2025, using data collected from the TMDB (The Movie Database(themoivedb.org)) API. Our goal was to build a full data science pipeline, from raw collection to analysis and visualizations. To highlight patterns in budget, revenue, and profitability over time."

The large gap between aerage budget and average revenue suggest that, on average, films are profitabel, but these averages are heavily influenced by a small number of extremely successful movies, who greatly exceeed their budget."

    "text": "Profit Over Time\n\nThis figure shows the average movie profit by year from 2005 to 2025. There is a clear upward trend in profitability through the mid-2010s, reflecting increasing budgets, global box office expansion, and franchise-driven releases.\nA sharp decline occurs around 2020, corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely disrupted theatrical releases. While profits recover in subsequent years, they do not immediately return to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a structural shift in the film industry."

Action, Adventure, and Animation films tend to generate the highest average profits, likely due to their global appeal and franchise potential.\nIn contrast, genres such as Drama and Romance show lower average profits, reflecting smaller budgets and more limited box office reach. This highlights how genre selection plays a significant role in financial outcomes."

Larger studios and productions houses dominate the list, benefiting from scale, marketing power, and established intellectual property.\nHowever, the presence of variability within companies suggest that even major studios experience hits and duds at the box office, which shows the inherent risk of film production."

The scatterplot reveals a strong positive relationship: films with larger budgets tend to generate higher revenues.\nHowever, the wide spread of points indicates substantial variance, meaning higher budgets do not guarantee success. This result supports the idea that while budget enables scale and visibility, market reception remains uncertain."

More recent decades exhibit higher median profits but also significantly greater variability and more extreme outliers.\nThe increasing spread suggests that modern film production has become a higher-risk, higher-reward industry, where a small number of blockbuster films drive much of the total profitability."
