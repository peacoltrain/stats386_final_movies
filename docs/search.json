The dataset spans movies released between 2005 and 2025.\n\n\n\n\nPurpose:\nCollects TMDB movie IDs from a specified range of years and writes them to a text file.\nInputs: - start_year (int): Starting release year - end_year (int): Ending release year\nOutputs: - ids.txt file containing collected TMDB movie IDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose:\nUses the TMDB API to fetch movie metadata for each ID in ids.txt and stores the data.\nInputs: - None (reads ids.txt)\nOutputs: - movies.json: Full movie metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose:\nCleans the full TMDB movie dataset by: - Filtering to U.S. movies with real budgets and revenues - Dropping movies missing release dates - Selecting only relevant fields (title, genres, revenue, etc.)\nInputs: - input_path: Path to raw movies.json - output_path: Path to cleaned output cleaned_movies.json\nOutput: - cleaned_movies.json: Final dataset with ~3,500 entries\n\n\n\n\n\nThis script performs all EDA (exploratory data analysis) and visualizations using the cleaned dataset.\n\n\n\nReads from cleaned_movies.json\nConverts release_date to datetime\nExtracts year column\nComputes profit = revenue - budget\n\n\n\n\nPrints: - Total number of movies - Average budget - Average revenue - Average profit\n\n\n\n\nLine plot showing the average movie profit over time (2005–2025)\n\n\n\n\n\nBar plot showing average profit for each movie genre\n\n\n\n\n\nBar plot of the top 15 production companies by average profit\n\n\n\n\n\nextract_genres(): Converts genre JSON into a list of genre names\nextract_companies(): Converts production companies JSON into list of company names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile | Description |\nids.txt | Movie IDs (raw list from TMDB) |\nmovies.json | Raw metadata for ~200K movies (not tracked in Git) |\ncleaned_movies.json | Final dataset used in analysis (3,503 entries) |\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was collected using the TMDB API and filtered to U.S.-based theatrical releases with complete financial data.\nYou must provide your own TMDB API key to run the data collection scripts.\nmovies.json is excluded from version control due to size limits."
